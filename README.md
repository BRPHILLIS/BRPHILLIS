<h2>Welcome to my Github.</h2> 

<br>

Currently I am working as a web developer for Ramsay Healthcare and in my spare time working on developing a large scale project for a company a partner and I started in early 2023.

I am most proficient and most enjoy developing with React, Typescript and anything revolving around the MERN stack however I love branching out and tackling tech outside that realm.

<h3>Recent Personal Project (MERN)</h3>

Recently, on the MERN stack I have developed a Travel review website where users can navigate around a 3D globe (using Mapbox) and leave reviews, users can interact with other users reviews by liking them, adding them or reporting them ( if necessary ) so the admin can review and take action using the admin features. 
Adding a pin to the map or leaving a review on an existing place will earn them contribution points to display on their profiles along side their total likes count.
This features authentication and authorization using JWT and Captcha 3.

I have hosted this on Vercel, please take a look and if you have an interesting travel story or review dont be afraid to leave a pin.
