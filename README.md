<h2>Welcome to my Github.</h2> 

<br>

Currently I am working as a web developer for Ramsay Healthcare and constantly developing projects to learn from.

I am most proficient and most enjoy developing with React, Typescript and anything revolving around the MERN stack however I love branching out and tackling tech outside that realm.

If you interested in having a chat please dont hesitate to message me on Linkedin &nbsp; &nbsp;

<h3>Recent Personal Project - Cryptocurrency Trading bot (NEXT.JS)</h3>

Link to repo: <a href="https://github.com/brphillis/gate-io-bot">https://github.com/brphillis/gate-io-bot</a>

### Features
- **Instant Buy and Sell**: The bot scans the exchange at regular intervals and instantly buys tokens that have dropped a certain amount since the last scan. It then places a sell order automatically.
- **Margin Token Monitoring**: Scrape the Gate.IO announcements page to identify newly listed margin tokens and purchases them as soon as the announcement is made.
- **Binance Announcements Integration**: Scrape the Binance announcements endpoint and automatically places orders on Gate.IO as soon as announcements are made.

<h3>Recent Personal Project - WorldWander Social Media Website (MERN)</h3>

Recently, on the MERN stack I have developed a Travel review website where users can navigate around a 3D globe (using Mapbox) and leave reviews, users can interact with other users reviews by liking them, adding them or reporting them ( if necessary ) so the admin can review and take action using the admin features. 
Adding a pin to the map or leaving a review on an existing place will earn them contribution points to display on their profiles along side their total likes count.
This features authentication and authorization using JWT and Captcha 3.

I have hosted this on Vercel, please take a look and if you have an interesting travel story or review dont be afraid to leave a pin.
